### zeqOS Project

The zeqOS project is based on a PPTOS called zeqOS. 

This project aims to bring zeqOS to life, For use on all kinds of systems.

## Here's our todo list:
- Kernel {Working on it}
- UI {Concept phase}*
- Apps {Not started}*

## Kernel
zeqOS is based off of a **custom** kernel, Which means apps from other OSes such as:
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**
will probably not be supported.
But, **BoneOS'S** Apps Will Be Supported.
